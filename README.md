This exercises are published in the article [Advanced interview questions](https://learnsql.com/blog/advanced-sql-interview-questions/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw6c63BhAiEiwAF0EH1EZlCSRAiVnLVb7HqSdY9L-GsysNfCCOVoSpstI3PMJIhyUvza5ejRoCw70QAvD_BwE) and some HackerRank questions I found while preparing/refreshing for Backend interview questions.

# Note:
The project includes a dev container for easying the execution of the queries, so no need to have your own database already setup.
